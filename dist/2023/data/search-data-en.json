The past year was exceptional, marked by a multitude of external factors that influenced the railroad industry at large and specifically impacted the operations of UTLC ERA. In the face of a changing external landscape, our primary objective was to uphold the highest level of integration with our shareholders, partners and clients. The final reported figures vividly highlight our collective efforts: in 2023, we successfully sustained our performance at the levels achieved during the remarkable years of 2021 and 2022, both in terms of transportation volumes and financial accomplishments. The year 2023 saw a plethora of challenges that necessitated swift collective decisions to shift transportation directions and traffic types. Timely technological solutions were, inter alia, instrumental in making up for delays in freight train speeds caused by infrastructural constraints related to ongoing construction work or the laying of additional tracks. The preceding year also witnessed the extension of our company’s transportation footprint, with the addition of 84 new routes to UTLC ERA’s operational map. The underlying principles of our Company’s ethos, namely integration, competence, responsibility, and reputation, remained steadfast. These business beacons have consistently underpinned our success and sustainable development. There is no reason to doubt that the UTLC ERA team has grown even more cohesive and proficient! Throughout the year, we welcomed onboard new top industry experts who are already contributing to bringing our growth strategy to fruition. As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate numerous compelling challenges ahead, with the primary focus on advancing Eurasian rail transit. I would like to thank all those who actively contributed to our collaborative endeavors in 2023 and helped us achieve our goals. It is a privilege to work alongside each of you.

Factors such as tepid demand from international partners, elevated inflationary pressures, and the tightening of monetary policy (MP) significantly curtailed the scope for potential growth, affecting components like exports and household consumption. Attention should also be focused on the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), which is a pro-active indicator for predicting international transportation demand. In 2023, the PMI index showed a declining trend (falling below 50 points), with negative trends in output and demand. This decline notably impacted trade and logistics demand. However, signs of improvement emerged in Q4, with a less pronounced decline in new orders and purchasing activity, along with a notable increase in business confidence reaching an eight-month high in December. Forecasts suggest a potential gradual recovery of the PMI in early 2024, with the index likely to enter a growth phase (>50 points) in Q2-Q3.

The decrease in consumption was mainly a result of the tightening of monetary policy (MP). Against a backdrop of high inflationary pressure caused by the weakening ruble and strong demand for imports, leading to a trade imbalance, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) raised the key rate multiple times throughout the year. Thus, the rate increased from 7.5% per annum in January to 16% by December.

In 2023, the total trade volume between these partners reached €734.1 billion, with China’s exports at €513.4 billion and the EU’s exports at €220.7 billion. This marked a decrease of 17.9% and 3.0%, respectively, compared to the previous year. The overall volume of trade in 2023 saw a 6.0% decline. The decrease in Chinese exports can be attributed to reduced European demand amidst economic uncertainties in the region and global geopolitical tensions. Conversely, the marginal decline in European exports in terms of value, accompanied by a significant drop in physical trade by 9.3%, could suggest a rising demand for higher-value goods and products in China, alongside a diminished interest in lower-priced but common commodity categories. Furthermore, considering China’s economic conditions and relatively subdued consumer spending, it is likely that the surge in demand is primarily driven by the industrial sector. It is significant that the upward trend in Europe’s trade deficit with China, which had been ongoing since 2019, came to a halt in 2023. The monthly average trade balance stood at €24.2 billion, down from €33.1 billion in 2022. While there has been an improvement in the trade balance, it is important to note that this change is accompanied by a decrease in Chinese exports, whereas European performance has remained steady.
